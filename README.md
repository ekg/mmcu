# memory makes computation universal, remember?

paper on universal computation, language models, and biological systems.

## code formatting notes

use one line per sentence style.

use em dashes (---) instead of hyphens (-) for parenthetical phrases.

```tex
this is not good. because we get one paragraph per line. see?

this is better.
it has one sentence per line.
then edits are easier, faster.
we can quickly reorder, remove and so on.

this shows proper em dashes---they connect phrases like this---while avoiding simple hyphens.
```

## Todo List

- Keep the proof rigorous and self-contained but avoid multiple redundant references and restatements.
- Integrate discussions about memory constraints in biological and AI systems into a single comparative section to avoid reiteration.
